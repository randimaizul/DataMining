Exercise 6.8 Why is the idf of a term always finite?
If we assume that DF(T) â‰  0 (i.e. that the respective query term T appears at least once, we can give an
upper bound for the IDF (for DF(T) = 1) as well as a lower bound (for DF(T) = N, see below). Because
we are dealing with a fixed, finite document set, there also is a finite set of possible values for the IDF
which are all between these two extreme values.
